# FAQ

## How do I find my time zone?

See the following guide on [finding time zones](finding-time-zones.md).

## Why isn't Friend Time messaging me when I react with the clock emoji?

Friend Time requires that you have **Direct Messages enabled** in at least one server that you share with Friend Time. Please check your **Privacy Settings** for the server.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't want to enable the setting in your server, consider joining the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/GQcBR8e), and enabling direct messages there.
{% endhint %}

## Why isn't the time zone list working?

Please check that the following are true:

* The server's [list setting](settings/server-settings/list.md) is enabled.
* There is **at least one** time zone in the [server's time zone list](commands/admin-commands/list.md).

## Can I set time zones for other users?

Yes. Please see the [set command](commands/user-commands/set.md#setup-for-another-user) for more information.
